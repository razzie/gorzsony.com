			Worked on multiple private custom made GTA5 (FiveM) mods and one public reference project:
			<blockquote>
				<h3>PocceMod | <a href="github.com/razzie/PocceMod">github.com/razzie/PocceMod</a></h3>
				After sharing with the community early on, the project went through 2 months of intensive development (200 commits in the first month and 150 in the second).
