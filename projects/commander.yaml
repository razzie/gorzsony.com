description: |-
  Execute Go functions from CLI or from a chatbot.
  Register any function as a command, then supply a context variable and a string slice as input arguments.
  If the original function has Context parameter(s), the context variable will be passed,
  otherwise the arguments from the string slice will be converted using Sscanf.
  The function's return values are converted into a []any slice and if any of these values is an error,
  it will be extracted into a separate error return value.
