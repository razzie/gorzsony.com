  Flyff.extra.hu was a hungarian fan site of Flyff (Fly For Fun) online game.
  During the 3-4 years of its existence I developed more and more new features to make it a fully functional web portal.
  It was very interesting to see it slowly getting attention.
  Members started generating content in the forms of forum entries, polls, screenshots and news for the home page.
  The site even had a few moderators and admins.
  In 2010 extra.hu decided to close its free hosting service and the site went offline.
  I could have moved it to a different(even paid) hosting service, but most members and I have already lost interest in the game.
