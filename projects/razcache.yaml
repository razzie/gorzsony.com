  A minimalist abstraction layer above Redis, Badger and a custom in-memory cache.
  As many of my self-hosted services rely on Redis for caching or data storage,
  I often had to fire up a local instance for manual testing.
  This process was too cumbersone for me, so I figured I could come up with a wrapper
  around Redis supporting the functionaly only I use the most, and during development
  it should mimic this functionality in-process.
  Supporting key expirations was a mandatory requirement, so the in-memory cache implements
  a "janitor" goroutine that cleans up these keys exactly when they expire, one at a time.
