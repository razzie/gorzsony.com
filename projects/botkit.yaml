description: |-
  A Telegram bot library designed to handle [commands](/projects/id/commander) and dialogs.
  Both of these support replying with sticker, photo, video, audio, album or file (even files not directly uploaded by the bot).
  Dialogs are composed of one or more queries, which can be single choice, multi choice or file queries.
  In theory you could run multiple instances to help balance the load,
  as long as they share the same Redis database.
