description: |-
  A lightweight webapp framework that powers [Razbox](/projects/id/razbox).
  Most of the original code was taken from [Razlink](/projects/id/razlink), but it has heavily evolved since.
  The core mechanic consists of registering pages (which are mostly a template + handler bundle)
  and returning view objects from inside the handlers.
  There are some utilities for session handling, access management and logging too, but this library is
  not suitable for production use.
