  A header-only multi-purpose library designed to help me get started with my projects.
  It includes frameworks for logging, events, input, memory, thread and network+serialization and has some additional stuff like:
  a bitset class with iterators for true and false position, stream manipulators and parsers and an easy to use random number generator.
