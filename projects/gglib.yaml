  GGlib and GGlib2 were libraries I used to develop between 2013 and 2017.
  They served as a sandbox to help me to learn about the new features of the C++11 standard.
  I also found a great use of them while working on other side projects.
  Due to some early design choices (including too heavy use of virtual function calls) I finally decided to send them into retirement
  and started working on the successor: [librazzie](https://github.com/razzie/librazzie).
