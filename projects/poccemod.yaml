  I made this mod originally for my tiny private FiveM server to have some fun with friends.
  (FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers.)
  Then I thought, why not share it with others? So I published it and listened to feedback from the community to improve it even more.
  The project went through 2 months of intensive development (200 commits in the first month and 150 in the second) until I ended up quite pleased with the results.
  Most of the FiveM player base and modder community is focused on role playing, while the goal of PocceMod was always to be a standalone sandbox entertainment mod.
  I was the first developer who enabled players to have fun with GTA's unused rope API in a multiplayer environment
  (since it's not synced by default).
