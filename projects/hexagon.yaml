  Hexagon is very similar to the Minecraft clone, but I wanted to try rendering hexagon blocks (hexagonal prisms to be correct) instead of cubes.
  The underlying datastructure is still a 3D grid of Perlin noise.
  One of the main differences is that this demo does not use textures, but has a custom shader that draws grass or rock detail based on the normal vectors.
