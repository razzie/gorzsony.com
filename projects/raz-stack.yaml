description: |-
  A simple Kubernetes stack that hosts many of my own projects plus an email service (Dovecot + Postfix) and Nextcloud.
  The goal of this project is simplified deployment and cost saving, horizontal autoscaling is not implemented.
  Many of the hosted webapps use a shared Redis (Kvrocks) instance with separate namespaces, thanks to [k8s-db-operator](/projects/id/k8s-db-operator).
  Deployment is done via Helmfile and Helm.
